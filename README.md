## Overview

The main code is in the notebook file [Network-for-cyber-data-w-analysis-PUB.ipynb](Network-for-cyber-data-w-analysis-PUB.ipynb). This contains _all_ of the data for the paper, including runs, data blobs, outputs, and analytical code. 

The random graph generator code was edited manually for each run, and the values used are in comments preserved, but not parameters that line up. These are only minor changes to the code, but we have preserved what was actually done to generate the data for the paper. 

## Contributions

No contributions will be accepted for this code as it is provided as-is as a record of the data runs to generate the results presented in the paper.
